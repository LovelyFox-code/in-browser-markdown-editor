# Frontend Mentor - In-browser markdown editor solution

This is a solution to the In-browser markdown editor challenge on Frontend Mentor.

### Converting Figma design with `React JS`, `styled-components`.

My learning goals were:

- Pixel-pretty-close implementation;
- Create, Save, Delete, Updaite the documents(`UI, back-end`);
- Use `styled-components` for styling;
- Work with State managment system;

### Design preview!

### The challenge

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

### Screenshot so far!

### Built with

- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### How to use:

- clone repository to your local folder`git clone https://github.com/LovelyFox-code/in-browser-markdown-editor`;
- install dependencies `npm install `;
- first run fake server `npm run fake-server`;
- split your terminal and run application `npm start`;
- enjoy exploring;

### Still TODO

```
- [] Clear text field in tab when a document is deleted
- [] When a new document is created, the tab should display its name
- [] When the name of the doc is edited, you can't select another doc anymore

## Styling


## Minor

- updates seem a bit slow (when change the name )
- Change markdown preview font to roboto

## Bonus

- syntax highlighting for the code blocks (check example in react-markdown)

```
